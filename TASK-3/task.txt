Topic: Personal Blog
A Personal Blog can do the same. Though a blog can be
created from basic to advanced level, initially you’re
recommended to opt for creating a basic blogging site using
HTML, CSS, and jQuery. And, if you’re having sound
knowledge of CSS Grid, Flexbox, Responsive Design, and
other related concepts, it would be more beneficial for you to
create an enriching Personal Blog page. Optional: Meanwhile,
Bootstrap also allows you to create a responsive blog that
can run on different screen sizes conveniently and efficiently.
