Topic: Survey Form
A Survey Form is commonly used for getting feedbacks,
customer preferences or requirements, and other related
information from the users. You have to create a responsive and
creative Survey Form to validate your HTML and CSS skills. In
this task, the HTML will allow you to create the structure of the
form and add various input fields for the usersâ€™ data such as
name, age, contact details, etc. and CSS will enable you to do the
styling for the input fields and the entire form such as field size,
background color and much more. Also, JavaScript can be used
in the form for validation tasks like character limit for input fields,
email id format validation, etc. **ONLY SURVEY FORM**
